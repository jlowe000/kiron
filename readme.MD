# This is the repo for my work @ #VizForSocialGood

This repo contains:

* The data (directory) containing data used by the visualisations. It is an aggregated view of the data from the various sources.
* The app (directory) containing sql scripts that are exports of Oracle Application Express (APEX) visualisations. There is an export of the application (which was based upon the Sample Charts) or the page itself for the Kiron Education project.
* The plugin (directory) containing sql scripts that is an export of custom plugin for the Timeline based upon the TimelineJS by Knight Lab.

The output of the analysis will not be here but as a blog (or two) to describe the story and impact of the analysis.

* For a youtube version of the pitch - see https://youtu.be/9Y-dId9FO_A
